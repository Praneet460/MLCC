### How to get started?
- <b>Fork</b> the repo on GitHub
- <b>Clone</b> the project to your own machine

### How to run Jupyter Notebook?
To run this notebook you need to <b>install necessary packages</b>, listed down. If you have not done so, you will need to install them first, as these are not in the Anaconda distribution as of now. From a command prompt on your computer type the following command. If no error occurs, you will have installed them.

``'pip install -r requirements.txt'`` 


### Pre-requisite
A bit of experience with Python, Pandas and Jupyter Notebook is sufficient. If you are a beginner in python then you can follow along with:
- [Python-QuickNotes](https://github.com/Openacademyedu/Python-QuickNotes)
